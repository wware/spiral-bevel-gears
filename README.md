spiral-bevel-gears
==================

It turns out Github lets you view STL files in 3D, which is very cool, and I think STL files can be sent off to
[Shapeways](http://www.shapeways.com/create) to be fabricated in different materials.

The spiral bevel gears, which I need to get a 90-degree change in a rotational axes, are from a
[Thingiverse design](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:10955) by
[GeneralRulofDumb](http://www.thingiverse.com/GeneralRulofDumb/designs).

I have some other pieces I'm going to need so I'll probably work on those in [Inkscape](http://www.inkscape.org/en/) and
[OpenSCAD](http://www.openscad.org/) which I believe can produce STL files as output. I just didn't want to
tackle doing intricate right-angle gears in OpenSCAD because I'm lazy and I'd probably get it wrong.
